UPTO:

- Make Settings accessible from the page edit page
- Navigation Builder
- SEO meta data
- Draft pages
- Preview
- Versioning


- Design the edit page view in.. figma?
-

- Need to implement more attributes on the page model
    - Meta title, Meta desc, keywords, Menu title, Show in Menus, ??> Image, OG Image?
- Need page types implementation for folder pages
    - Other base page types are:
        - Folder
          - Attributes: none
        - BlogCollection
           - Attributes:
        - Redirect:
            - Attributes: link DTO (type (url, email, phone, page, media, value, new Window)
                These can go in type_data
        - BlogPost: Leave this one for now
            - Attributes:  author, tags, categories - actually these can all be many_many realtionships
               then we don't need a separate table for them. Only tricky part is versioning...

page.type_data vs page.typeRecord()
	•	Use JSON Column When:
	•	The page type has few additional fields, and these fields are not used in complex queries.
	•	The page type’s structure might change frequently, and you want to avoid frequent schema migrations.
	•	The additional data is optional, or the page type is not central to your application’s core functionality.
	•	Use Separate Tables When:
	•	The page type has a well-defined and stable set of additional fields.
	•	You need to enforce strong data integrity, with relationships to other tables.
	•	The data will be used in complex queries, filtering, or reporting.

- Sortable Page table - not quite working with complex combos of grouping and sorting
- ^ Solution for now:
    - Implement page types, specifically the folder page type
    - Clicking on a folder page will open a new page with a list of pages in that folder
    - Enable sorting on the list of pages in the folder page
